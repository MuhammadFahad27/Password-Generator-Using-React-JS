The Random Password Generator is a simple yet powerful web application built using React JS that allows users to generate strong, secure passwords. This app provides an interactive user interface where users can customize their passwords based on their requirements, including choosing the number of characters, including numbers and special characters, and generating a password that meets their specific criteria.

The main objective of this project is to provide a quick and customizable password generator that helps users create passwords that are both secure and easy to remember. This app can be particularly useful for anyone who needs to generate strong passwords for online accounts, ensuring that their information is protected.

Features
1. Password Length Customization
Users can select the length of the generated password by choosing a number from a dropdown or a slider. This gives flexibility in determining how long the password should be, making it customizable based on individual security needs.
2. Include Numbers in Password
The app allows users to include numbers in the generated password. A checkbox option is provided for the user to check if they want numbers (0-9) to be part of the generated password.
If the checkbox is selected, numbers will be included randomly in the password, helping ensure the password is strong and difficult to guess.
3. Include Special Characters
Users can also opt to include special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, &, etc.) in their passwords. This option is enabled through a checkbox.
When the user checks this box, the password will include special characters in addition to letters and numbers, further strengthening its complexity and security.
4. Include Lowercase and Uppercase Characters
The password can be generated with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
.5. Password Generation Button
Once the user has selected the desired settings (length, inclusion of numbers, special characters, and letter case), they can click on the Generate Password button.
The app will generate a random password according to the selected settings and display it on the screen.
6. Copy to Clipboard Feature
A Copy button is provided next to the generated password. When the user clicks on this button, the generated password is copied to the clipboard.
This feature allows users to quickly copy the password without the need to manually select and copy the text, streamlining the process and making it more convenient.
7. User-friendly Interface
The app has a clean and simple UI with an intuitive layout that makes it easy for users to select options and generate passwords.
Responsive design ensures the app works seamlessly on different screen sizes, including mobile and desktop devices.
